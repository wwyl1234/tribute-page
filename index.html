      <h2>Facts:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Because of Linus Torvalds, we now have many Linux distributions. He is the main developer of the Linux kernel. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There is also a law named in honour of him. 
          It is called the Linus's law which asserts "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". 
          In other words, the more people looking into the same problem, someone would quickly find a fix. 
        </li>
        <li>
          His favourite colour is yellow.
        </li>
        <li>
          He is also the creator of Git, a distributed version control system.
        </li>
        <li>
          He also built Subsurface with Dirk Hohndel, which is an open-source software that logs and plans scuba dives.
